# Assignment #2

## Instructions

Complete the Timer class in assignment.py

- The Timer class measure the elapsed time of a given function
- It can measure the elapsed time in seconds and milliseconds (constructor)
- Run the code to verify a correct execution

Additionally,

- Must be well documented
- Just fill the space assigned to code in the file assignment.py
- Pass flake8 test

After the code is ready to be sent, add your assignment to your course repository in GitHub, and send the link to me (cristhian.aguilera@ulagos.cl). Your repository must have the following structure

- Assignments
  - 02
  - ..

## Tips

- Look for how to measure elapsed time using time.time()
- Understand what the code does before coding
  - Understand how a function is passed as an argument

## Evaluation

Rubric (21 pts):

| Item              | Good (7 pts)                                               | Average (4 pts)                                                  | Bad (0pt)                                |
|:------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Example execution | The example works well, and the time is measured correctly | The example doesn't measure always correctly the execution time  | The timer doesn't measure time correctly |
| Flake8            | The code pass flake8 test                                  | The code has up to 5 flake8 test errors                          | The code has more than 5 errors          |
| Documentation     | The code is clearly commented according to standard        | The code is vaguely commented, not following always the standard | The code has not comments                |

Discounts

- 7 points per day of delay. (not in hours, just when changing date)
- 21 points if code is not in GitHub
