## Instructions

Make a CLI python game to guess a number. The game must

- Generate a random int number each time
- Accept guesses from user (via keyboard)
- Give clues after each guess
  - The number is lower or higher than the one entered
- Finish when the game is done

Additionally,

- Must be well documented
- Must have clear instructions while playing
- Just fill the space assigned to code in the file assignment.py
- Pass flake8 test

After the code is ready to be sent, add your assignment to your course repository in GitHub, and send the link to me (cristhian.aguilera@ulagos.cl). Your repository must have the following structure

- Assignments
